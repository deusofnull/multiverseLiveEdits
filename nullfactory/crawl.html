		<p> and that was the first true thing i said “this is just a mood” and it'll pass.  however melodramatic life paints itself, ill eventually get back to the wholeness i so often fail to see.  i wish i could hear a cathedral reverberation of a beautiful sound I made.  I wish i weren't just chirping in the closet full of clothes i won't wear.  i wish i were smaller so that everything else seemed bigger.  i wish a lot of things and that doesn't get me anywhere.</p>
		<p> sometimes, i ride on a conveyor belt.  other times, i roll down hills.  now, i just amp up the electric bill.
what can you say for crawling but that the world seems a grander place?  I would revert to oblivion if it were even possible for my heart to accept it.  i cannot, or will not, or will myself not to be the pollen in the wind, i wish too strongly for roots and branches and everything between the groundwater and the leaves. </p>
		<p> i see it all, whole systems of life before me of every color and intensity.  i remind myself that i am too a part of many systems.  none of them seem present.  they are all far off on continents yet formed by shifting tectonics.  in many ways this is ok to me; i see them in my imagination just as well as i would standing on the enormous beaches of some future Pangea. </p>
		<p> crestfallen, what a anticlimatic disposition.  just the final stop of a sine wave.  the 360th degree of rotation.  the kiss and snap of spacetime bent to the point of express line union; a wormhole reaching orgasm.  a mood like this denies the spiritual and reasserts the dreadful in crippling detail.  were it not so cold out I would vanquish this unwarranted focus on the shadow of an apple tree.   i would climb down the stairs and with my running-est feet escape the gravity of a decomposing warehouse full of my  imaginations half assembled mannequins.  i would run on like a sentence i wrote, run on forever and ever.  </p>
		<p> it's clever to write for catharsis, but if it is effective, you might find yourself writing something new half way through and have to, or choose to, remind yourself of that quiet dispossession you priorly held to your breast.  maybe you'll shift perspective wildly like the shaking hands of a photographer ill-fated for their passions.  </p> 
		<p> im trying to remember not to reread what has been written, as we all know when meditating you musn't  focus entirely on the inward breath.  to breath in broad strokes is how one sates one's floodgates.  i musn't forget to exhale.  </p>
		<p> a wandering thought: those escalators you ride morning and night might one day loosen their hold on their incline.  they'll free themselves from the constant of 45degrees, enter a parallel asana to the ground, becoming like the treads of a snowmobile.  the entire building is liberated.  it carries passengers in elevation no more, carrying only itself with forward propulsion.  </p>
		<p> it is a solemn achievement to outgrow one's function.  </p>
		<p> but time presses us forward, and so often this feels like standing still.  </p>
	      <p> once you've fallen to your knees and shaken your fists at the sky,  </p>
		<p> give into that pressing weight,  </p>
		<p>return those aluminum mitts to the floor, </p>
		<h1> crawl. </h1>
